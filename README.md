# Description
Our goal was to create a movie search page that would enable the user to search for movies and save them under a profile in their own device either mobile or desktop.
We divided the project into sections starting with the server side with the apollo server express server, MongoDB, and express.js
Then once we finished the server side we started working on the client side with REACT where we worked on version control which was the biggest challenge we faced.
We met every day in order to share our work and save it to our develop branch so everyone started the next day with the latest changes.
Once we finshed the client side we met in order to fix any bugs that came up before launching the build for the website on the local host.
Once the MVP was ready we were able to successfully deploy the full application to Heroku on Tuesday.
Finally, we worked on things such as giving the website a more polished look using CSS, adding a footer, and the README file.
